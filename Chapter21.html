      In this Chapter, Hemadpant relates the stories of Vinayak Harishchandra Thakur, B.A., Anantarao Patankar of Poona, and 
      a Pleader from Pandharpur. All these stories are very interesting which if very carefully read and grasped, will lead the 
      readers on the spiritual path.

    <h4>Preliminary</h4>
    <p>
      It is a general rule, that it is our good luck in the form of accumulation of merits in past births, that enables us to seek the 
      company of Saints and profit thereby. In illustration of this rule, Hemadpant gives his own instance. He was resident Magistrate 
      of Bandra, A suburb of Bombay, for many years. A famous Mohamedan Saint named Pir Moulana was living there and many Hindus, Parsis
      and many others who followed different religion used to go to him and take his darshan. His Mujavar (priest) by name Inus pressed 
      Hemadpant many a time, night and day, for going to see him, but for some reason or other he was not able to see him. After many years
      his turn came and he was called to Shirdi where he was permanently enlisted in Sai Baba's Darbar. Unfortunate fellows do not get this 
      contact of the Saints. It is only the fortunate ones that get it.

    <h4>Institution of Saints</h4>
    <p>
      There have been institutions of Saints in the world, from time immemorial. Various Saints appear (incarnate) themselves in various places
      to carry out the missions allotted to them, but though they work in different places, they are, as it were, one. They work in unison under
      the common authority of the Almighty Lord and know full well what each of them is doing in his place, and supplement his work where necessary.
      An instance illustrating this is given below.

    <h4>Mr. Thakur</h4>
    <p>
      Mr. V.H.Thakur, B.A., was a clerk in the Revenue Department and he once came to a town named Vadgaum near Belgaum (S.M. Country) along with a 
      Survey party. There he saw a Kanarese Saint (Appa) and bowed before him. The Saint was explaining a portion from the book "Vichar-Sagar" of 
      Nischaldas (a standard work on Vedanta) to the audience. When Thakur was taking his leave to go, he said to him, "you should study this book,
      and if you do so, your desires will be fulfilled, and when you go to the North in the discharge of your duties in future, you will come across 
      a great Saint by your good luck, and then he will show you the future path, and give rest to your mind and make you happy."
