      In the last chapter, we described how Baba's word and grace cured many incurable diseases. Now, we shall describe, how Baba blessed Mr. Ruttonji Wadia with an issue.

    <p>
      The life of this Saint is naturally sweet in and out. His various doings, eating, walking and His natural sayings are also sweet. His life is Bliss incarnate. Sai gave it out as a means of
      His devotee's remembrance to Him. He gave them various stories of duty and action, which ultimately led them to true religion. His object may be that people should live happily in this world,
      but they should be ever cautious and gain the object of their life, viz. self-realization. We get human body as a result of merits in past birth and it is worth-while that with its aid, we
      should attain devotion and liberation in this life. So we should never be lazy, but always be on the alert to gain our end and aim for life.

    <p>
      If you daily hear the Leelas (stories) of Sai, you will always see Him. Day and night you will remember Him in your mind, when you assimilate Sai in this way, your mind will lose its fickleness
      and if you go in this manner, it will finally be merged in pure consciousness.

    <h4>Ruttonji of Nanded</h4>
    <p>
      <b>N</b>ow let us come to the main story of this Chapter. In Nanded, in the Nizam state, there lived a Parsi mill-contractor and trader, by name Ruttonji Shapurji Wadia. He had amassed a large
      amount of money and had acquired fields and lands. He had got cattle, horses nad conveyances and was very prosperous. To all outward appearances he looked very happy and contended, but inwardly,
      and really he was not so. Providential dispensation in such, that no one in this world is completely happy and rich; Ruttonji was no exception to this. He was liberal and charitable, gave food and
      clothing to the poor and helped all in various ways. The people took him to be a good and happy man, but Ruttonji thought himself miserable as he had no issue, male or female, for a long time. As
      Kirtan (singing glories of the Lord) without love or devotion, music of singing without rhythmical accompaniments, Brahmin without the sacred thread, proficiency in all arts without commonsense, pilgrimage
      without repentance and ornamentation without a neckalce, are ugly and useless, so in the house of a man or house-holder without a male issue. Ruttonji always brooded on this matter and said in his mind,
      "Would God be ever pleased to grant me a son?" He this looked morose, had no relish for his food.Day and night, he was enveloped with anxiety whether he would ever be blessed with a son. He had a great
      regard for Dasganu Mahajat. He saw him and opened his heart before him. Dasganu advised him to go to Shirdi, take Baba's darshan, fall at his feet and seek his blessing and pray for issue. Ruttonji liked the
      idea, and decided to go to Shirdi. After some days he went to Shirdi, took Baba's darshana and fell at his feet. Then opening a basket, he took out a beautiful garland of flowers and placed it around Baba's
      neck and offered him a basket of fruits. With great respect he then sat near Baba, and prayed to Him saying-"Many persons who find themselves in difficult situations come to you, and you relieve them immediately.
      Hearing this, I have sought anxiously your feet; please, therefore, do not disappoint me." Sai Baba then asked him for Dakshina of Rs. five which Ruttonji intended to give, but added, that he has already received
      Rs. 3-14-0 from him, and that he should pay the balance only. Hearing this, Ruttonji was rather puzzled. He could not make out what Baba meant. That was the first time, he thought, that he went to Shirdi and how
      was it that Baba said that He had formerly got Rs. 3-14-0 from him? He could not solve the riddle. But he sat at Baba's Feet and gave the balance of the Dakshina asked for, explained to Baba fully, as to why he
      came and sought His help, and prayed that Baba should bless him with a son. Baba was moved and told him not to be worried, and that time his bad days had ended. He then gave him Udi, placed his hand on his head
      and blessed him saying that Allah (God) would satisfy his heart's desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after taking Baba's leave, Ruttonji returned to Nanded and told Dasganu everything that took place at Shirdi, He said that everything went on well there, that he got Baba's darshan and blessing with Prasad, but
      there was one thing which he could not understand. Baba said to him that he had got Rs. 3-14-0 before. Please explain as to what Baba meant by this remark. He said to Dasganu, "I never went to Shiridi before, and how could I
      give him the sum to which Baba referred?" To Dasganu also, it was a puzzle, and he pondered much over it for a long time. Sometime afterwards it struck him that Ruttonji had received some days ago a Mahomedan Saint, by
      name Moulisaheb, in his house and had spent some money for his reception. This Moulisaheb was coolie-saint wellknown to the people of Nanded. When Ruttonji decided to go the Shirdi, this Moulisaheb accidentally came to
      Ruttonji's house. Ruttonji know him and loved him. So he gave a small party in his honour. Dasganu got from Ruttonji the yadi or memo of expenses of this reception, and everybody was wonderstruck to see, that the expenses
      amounted to exactly 3-14-0, nothing more, nothing less. They all came to know, that Baba was omniscient, that thought He lived in Shirdi, He knew what happened outside for away from Shirdi. In fact He knew the past, present
      and future, and could identify Himself heart and soul with anybody. In this particular instance how could he know the reception given to Moulisaheb, and the amount spent therefore, unless He could identify Himself with him, and
      be one with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruttonji was satisfied with this explanation and his faith in Baba was confirmed and increased. In due time afterwards, he was blessed with a son and his joy knew no bounds. It is said that he had in all a dozen (12) issues
      out of which only four survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a foot-note towards the end of this chapter, it is stated that Baba told Rao Bahadur Hari Vinayak Sathe, after the death of his first wife, to remarry and that he would get a son. R.B. Sathe married second time. The first two
      issues by this wife were daughters and he, therefore, felt very despondent. But the third issue was a son. Baba's word did turn out true and he was satisfied.
    </p>
    <h4>Dakshina - Mimansa</h4>
    <p>
      <b>N</b>ow we shall close this chapter with a few remarks about Dakshina. It is well-known fact that Baba always asked for Dakshina from people who went to see Him. Somebody may ask a question, "If Baba was a Fakir and perfectly
      non-attached, why should he ask for Dakshina and care for money?" We shall consider this question broadly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      First for a long time, Baba dod not accept anything. He stored burnt matches and filled His pocket with them. He never asked anything from anybody -- whether he be a devotee or otherwise. If anybody placed before Him a pice or two,
      He purchased oil or tobacco. He was fond of tobacco, for He always smoked a bidi or Chilim (earthen pipe). Then some persons thought that they could not see the saints empty-handed, and they, therefore, placed some copper coins before baba.
      Of a pice was placed before him. He used to pocket it; if it was a two pice coin, it was returned immediately. Then after Baba's fame had spread far and wide, people began to flock in numbers; and Baba began to ask Dakshina from them. It is
      said in the Shruthi (veda) that Puja of the God is not complete, unless a gold coin is offered. If a coin was necessary in the Puja of the Gods, why should it be not so in the Puja of the Saints also? Ultimately, the Shastras laid it down that,
      when one goes to see God, King, Saint or Guru, he should not go empty-handed. He should offer something, preferably coin or money. In this connection we may notice the precepts recommended by the Upanishads. The Brihadaranyak Upanishad says
      that the Lord Prajapati advised the Gods, men and demons by one letter "Da". The Gods understood by this letter that they should practice (1) "Dama" i.e., self-control; the men thought or understood that they should practice (2) "Dana" i.e. charity; thee demons understood
      that they should practice (3) "Daya" i.e. compassion. To men Charity or giving was recommended. The teacher in the Taittiriya Upanishad exhorts his pupils to practise charity and other virtues. Regarding charity the says, "Give with faith, give the
      magnanimity, i.e. liberally, give with modesty, with awe and with sympathy. In order to teach the devotees the lesson of charity and to remove their attachment to money and thus to purity their minds, Baba extracted Dakshina from them; but there was
      this peculiarity, as Baba said, that He had to give back hundred times more of what He received. There are many instances, in which this has happened. To quote an instance, Mr. Ganpatrao Bodas, the famous actor, says in his Marathi autobiography, that on
      Baba's pressing him often and often for Dakshina, he emptied his money-bag before him. The result of this was, as Mr. Bodas says, that in the later life he never lacked money, as it came to him abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also secondary meanings of Dakshina, in many cases, in which Baba did not want any pecuniary amount. To quote two instances - (1) Baba asked Rs. 15/- as Dakshina from Pro. G.G. Narke, who replied that he did not have even a pie. Then Baba said,
      "I know you have no money; but you are reading Yoga-Vashistha. Give me dakshina from that." Giving Dakshina in this case meant - ' Deriving lessons from the book abd lodging them in the heart where Baba resides'. (2) In the second case Baba asked a certain lady
      (Mrs. R.A. Tarkhad) to give Rs. 6/- as Dakshina. The lady felt pained, she had nothing to give. Then her husband explained to her that Baba wanted six inner enemies (lust, anger, avarice etc.) to be surrendered to Him. Baba agreed with this explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be noted, that though Baba collected a lot of money by Dakshina, He would distribute the whole amount the same day, and the next morning He would become a poor Fakiras usual. When Baba took His Mahasamadhi, after receiving thousands and thousands of Rupees
      as Dakshina for about ten years, He had only a few Rupees in His possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Baba's main object in taking Dakshina, from his devotees was to teach them the lessons of Renunciation and Purification.
