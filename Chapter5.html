    <h4>Return with Chand Patil's Marriage party</h4>
    <p>
      As hinted in the last Chapter, I shall now describe first how Sai Baba returned to Shirdi after his disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lived in the Aurangabad District (Nizam State), in a village called Dhoop, a well-to-do Mahomedan gentleman by name Chand Patil. While he was making a trip to Augrangabad,
      he lost his mare. For two ling months, he made a diligent search but could get no trace of the lost mare. After being disappointed, he returned from Aurangabad with the saddle on
      his back. After travelling four koss and a half, he came, on the way, to a mango tree under the foot of which sat a RATNA (queer fellow). He had a cap on his head, wore Kafni (long
      robe) and had a "Satka" (Short Stick) under his armpit and He was preparing to smoke a Chilim (pipe). On seeing Chand Patil pass by the way, He called out of him and asked him to have
      a smoke and to rest a little. The Fakir asked him about the saddle. Chand Patil replied that it was of his mare, which was lost. THe queer fellow or Fakir asked him to make a search in
      the Nala close by. He went and the wonder of wonders! He found out the mare. He thought that this Fakir was not an ordinary man, but an Avalia (a great saint). He returned to the Fakir
      with the mare. The Chilim was ready for being smoked, but two things were wanting: (1) fire to light the pipe, and (2) water to wet the Chhapi (piece of cloth through which smoke is drawn
      up). THe Fakir took his prong and thrust it forcibly into the ground and out came a live burning coal, which He put on the pipe. Then he dashed the Sakta on the ground, from whence water began to ooze.
      The Chhapi was wetted with that water, was then wrung out and wrapped round the pipe. Thus everything being complete, the Fakir smoked the Chilim and then gave it also to Chand Patil. On
      seeing all this, Chand Patil was wonderstuck. He requested the Fakir to come to his home and accept his hospitality. Next day he went to the patil's house and stayed there for sometime. The
      Patil was a village - officer of Dhoop. His wife's brother's son was to be married and the bride was from Shirdi. So Patil made preparations to start for Shirdi for the marriage. The Fakir also
      accompained the marriage party. The marriage wen off without any hitch, the party returned to Dhoop, except the Fakir alone stayed in Shirdi, and remained there forever.
    </p>
    <h4>How the Fakir got the name Sai</h4>
    <p>
      When the marriage party came to Shirdi, it alighted at the foot of a Banyan tree in Bhagat Mahalsapati's field near Khandoba's temple. The carts were loosened in the open in the open courtyard
      of Khandoba's temple, and the members of the party descended one by one, and the Fakir also got down. Bhagat Mahalsapati saw the young Fakir getting down and accosted hime "YA SAI" (Welcome Sai).
      Others also addressed Him as Sai and thenceforth he became to known as Sai Baba.
    </p>
    <h4>Contact with Other Saints</h4>
    <p>
      Sai Baba began to stay in a deserted Masjid. One Saint named Devidas was living in Shirdi many years before Baba came there. Baba liked his company. He stayed with him in the Maruti temple, in the
      Chavadi, and sometime lived alone. Then came another Saint by name Jankidas. Baba spent most of His time in talking with him, or Jankidas went to Baba's residence. So also one Vaishya householder
      Saint, from puntambe by name Gangagir always frequented Shirdi. When he first saw Sai Baba, caryying pitchers of water in both hands, for watering the garden, he was amazed and said openly, 'Blessed is Shirdi',
      that it got this precious Jewel. THis man is carrying water today; but he is not an ordinary fellow. As this land (Shirdi) was lucky and meritorious, it secured this Jewel." So also one famous Saint
      by name Anandnath of Yewala Math, a disciple of Akkalkot Maharaj came to Shirdi with some Shirdi people. When he saw Sai Baba, he said openly, "This is a precious Diamond in reality. Though he looks
      like an ordinary man, he is not a 'gar' (ordinary stone) but a Diamond. You will realize this in the near future." Saying this returned to Yewala. This was said while Sai Baba was a youngster.
    </p>
    <h4>Baba's Dress and Daily Routine</h4>
    <p>
      In his young days, Sai baba grew hair on his Head; never had his head shaved. He dressed like an athlete. When he went to Rahata (3 miles from Shirdi), He brought with Him small plants of Merry Gold, Jai and Jui,
      and after cleaning, he planted and watered them. A devotee by name Vaman Tatya supplied Him daily with two earthen pitchers. With these Baba himself used to water plants. He drew water from the well and carried
      the pitchers on his shoulders. In the evening the pitchers were kept at the foot of the Neem tree. As soon as they were placed there, they were broken, as they were made of raw earth and not baked. Next day,
      Tatya supplied two fresh pitchers. This course went on for 3 years; and with Sai Baba's toil and labour, there grew a flower garden. On this site, at present, stands the big mansion - Samadhi Mandir of Baba, which
      is now frequented and used by so many devotees.
    </p>
    <h4>The Story of the Padukas</h4>
    <p>
      A devotee of Akkalkot Maharaj by name Bhai Krishnaji Alibagkar worshiped the photo of Akkalkot Maharaj. He once thought of going to Akkalkot (Sholapur District), taking the darshana of the Padukas (foot prints) of
      the Maharaj and offering his sincere worship there; but before he could go there, he got a vision in his dream. Akkalkot Maharaj appeared in his vision and said to him - "Now Shirdi is my resting place, go there
      and offer your worship." So Bhai changed his plan and came to Shirdi, worshipped Baba, stayed there for six months and was happy. As a reminiscence of his vision etc., he prepared the Padukas and installed  them on
      an auspicious day of Shravan, Shaka 1834 (1912 A.D.) under the Neem tree with due ceremonies and formalities, conducted by Dada Kelkar and Upasani. One Dixit Brahmin was appointed for worship, and the management was
      entrusted to devotee sagun.
    </p>
    <h4>Complete version of this story</h4>
    <p>
      Mr. B.V. Deo, Retired Mamaltadar of Thana, and a great devotee of Sai Baba, made enquired about this matter with Sagun Meru Naik and Govind Kamlakar Dixit and has published a full version of the Padukas in Sai Leela Vol.
      11, No. 1, page 25. It runs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1834 Shaka (1912 A.D.) one Doctor Ramarao Kothare of Bombay came to Shirdi for Baba's darshana. His compounder; and his friend, Bhai Krishnaji Alibagkar, accompanied him. The compounder and Bhai became intimate with
      Sagun Meru Naik and G.K. Dixit. While discussing things, these persons thought that there must be some memorial of the fact of Sai Baba's first coming to Shirdi and sitting under the holy Neem tree. They thought of
      installing Baba's Padukas there and were going to make them of some rough stones. Then Bhai's friend. the compounder, suggested that if this matter be made known to his master, Dr. Ramarao Kothare, who would prepare nice
      Padukas for this purpose. All liked the proposal and Dr. Kothare was informed of it. He came to Shirdi and drew a plan of the Padukas. He went to Upasani Maharaj in Khandoba's temple, and showed him his plan. The latter
      made many improvements, drew lotuses, flowers, conch, disc, man etc., and suggested that the following SHLOKA (verse) regarding Neem tree's greatness and Baba's Yogi powers be inscribed. The verse was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sada Nimbavrikshasya Mooladhiwasat | <br>
      Sudha Sravinam Tiktamapya-priyantam || <br>
      Tarun Kalpavrikshadhikam Saadhayantam | <br>
      Namameeshwaram Sadgurum Sai Natham" ||
    </p>
    <p>
      Upasani's suggestions were accepted and carried out. The Padukas were made in Bombay and set to Shirdi with the compounder. Baba said that they should be installed on the Pournima (15th) of Shravan. On that day at 11 a.m.,
      G.K.Dixit brought them on his head from Khandoba's temple to the Dwarakamai (Masjid) in procession. Baba touched the Padukas, saying that these are the feet of the Lord and asked the people to install them, under foot of the
      Neem tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day before, one Parsi devotee of Bombay named Pastha Shet sent Rs. 25/- by money order. Baba gave this sum for the installation of the Padukas. The total expense of installation came up to Rs. 100/- out of which Rs. 75/- were
      collected by subscriptions. For the first 5 years, G.K.Dixit worshipped the Padukas daily and then Laxman Kacheswar Jakhadi did this. In the first five years, Dr. Kothare sent Rs. 2 per month for lighting and he also sent the
      railing round the Padukas. The expense of bringing the railing from the station to Shirdi (Rs. 7-8-0) (presently Rs. 7.50p) and roofing was paid by Sagun Meru Naik. Now, Jakhadi (Nana Pujari) does the worship and Sagun Meru Naik
      offers the naivaidya and lights the evening lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bhai Krishnaji was originally a devotee of Akkalkot Maharaj. He had come to Shirdi at the installation of the Padukas, in Shaka 1834 on his way to Akkalkot. He wanted to go to Akkalkot after taking the darshana of Baba. He asked
      Baba's permission for this. Baba said - "Oh, what is there in Akkalkot? Why do you go there? The incumbent Maharaj of that place is here, Myself." Hearing this Bhai did not go to Akkalkot. He came to Shirdi off and on, after the
      installation of the Padukas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. B.V. Deo concluded that Hemadpant did not know these details. Had be known them, he would not have failed to depict them in his Satcharitra.
    </p>
    <h4>Wrestling Bout with Mohdin and Change in Life</h4>
    <p>
      To return to other stories of Baba. There was a wrestler in Shirdi, by name Mohid Tamboli. Baba and he did not agree on some items, and both had fight. In this Baba was defeated. Thenceforth, Baba changed his dress and mode of living.
      He donned Kafni, wore a Langot (waist band) and covered his head with a piece of cloth. He took a piece of sackcloth for his seat, sackcloth for his bed and was content with wearing torn and worn out rags. He always said "Poverty is better
      than Kinship, far better than Lordship. The Lord is always brother (befriender) of the poor." Gangagit was also very fond of wrestling, While he was once wrestling, a similar feeling of dispassion came over him, and at the proper time he heard
      the voice of an adept, saying that he should wear out his body, playing with God. So he too gave up Samsara and turned towards God-realization. He established a math on the banks of the river near Puntambe, and lived there with disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sai Baba did not mix and speak with the people. He only gave answers when he was questioned. By day he always sat under the Neem tree, somtime under the shade of a branch of a Babul tree near the stream at the outskirts of the village. In the
      afternoon, He used to walk to random and go at times to Nimagaon. There he frequented the house of Balasaheb Dengale. Baba loved Mr. Balasaheb his younger brother, named Nanasaheb, had no son, though he married a second wife. Balasaheb sent Nanasaheb
      for taking darshana of Sai Baba, and after sometime with his frace, Nanasaheb got a son. From that time onwards, people began to come in numbers to see Sai Baba, and his fame began to spread and reached Ahmednagar, from thence Nanasaheb Chandorkar and
      Keshav Chidambar, and many others began to come to Shirdi. Baba was surrounded by His devotees during day; and slept at night in an old and dilapaidated Masjid. Baba's paraphernalia at this time consisted of Chilim, tobacco, a "Tumrel" (tin pot), long
      flowing Kafni, a piece of cloth round his head, and a Satka (short stick), which He always kept with him. The piece of white on the head was twisted like matted hair, and flowed down from the left war on the back. This was not washed for weeks. He wore
      no shoes, no sandals. A piece of sackcloth was his seat for most of the day. He wore a coupin (waist-cloth-band) and for warding off cold he always sat in front of a Dhuni (sacred fire) facing south with His left hand resting on the wooden railing. In
      that Dhuni, he offered as oblation; egoism, desires and all thoughts and always uttered Allah Malik (God is the sole owner). The Masjid in which He sat was only of two room dimensions, where all devotees came and saw him. After 1912 A.D., there was a
      change. The old Masjid was repaired and a pavement was constructed. Before Baba came to live in this Masjid, He lived for a long time in a place Takia, where with GHUNGUR (small bells) on his legs, Baba danced beautifully sand with tender love.
    </p>
    <h4>Turning Water into Oil</h4>
    <p>
      Sai Baba was very fond of lights. He used to borrow oil from shopkeepers, and keep lamps burning the whole night in the Masjid and temple. This went on for sometime. The Banias, who supplied oil gratis, once met together and decided not to give him oil.
      When, as usual, Baba went to ask for oil, they all gave hime a distinct NO. Unperturbed, Baba returned to the Masjid and kept the dry wicks in the lamps. The Banias were watching him with curiosity. Baba took the Tumrel (tin pot) which contained bery little
      (a few drops of oil, put water into it and drank it and forced it fall in the container. After consecrating the tin-pot in this way, He again took water in the tin-pot and filled all the lamps with it and lighted them. To the surprise and dismay of the
      watching Banias, the lamps began to burn and kept burning the whole night. The Banias repented and apologized. Baba forgave them and asked them to be more truthful in future.
    </p>
    <h4>The Pseudo-Guru Javhar Ali</h4>
    <p>
      Five years after the wrestling bout mentioned above, one Fakir from Ahmednagar by name Javhar Ali came to Rahata with his disciples and stayed in Bakhal (spacious room) near Virabhadra temple. The Fakir was learned, could repeat the whole Koran and had a
      sweet tongue. Many religious and devout people of the village came to him and began to respect him. With the help of the people, he started to build Idgah (a wall before which Mahomedans pray on Idgah day), near the Virabhadra temple. There was some quarrel
      about this affair, on account of which, Javhar Ali had to leave Rahata. Then he came to Shirdi and lived in the Masjid with Baba. People were captured by his sweet talk, and he began to call Baba as his disciple. Baba did not object and consented to be his
      chela. Then both Guru and Chela decided to return to Rahata and live there. The Guru (Teacher) never knew his disciple's worth, but the disciple knew the defects of the Guru, still he never disrespected him, observing carefully his duties. He even served the
      Master in various ways. They used to come to Shirdi off and on, but their main stay was in Rahata. The loving devotees of Baba in Shirdi did not like, that Baba should stay away from them in Rahata. So they went in a deputation to bring Baba back to Shirdi.
      when they met Baba near the Idgah and told the purpose for which they came, Baba said to them that the Fakirwas an ill-tempered fellow, he would not leave him and that they should better return to Shirdi without him, before the Fakir returned. While they were
      thus talking, the Fakir turned up and was very angry with them for trying to take away his disciple. There was some discussion and altercation and it was finally decided that both the Guru and Chela should return to Shirdi. And so they returned and lived in Shirdi.
      But after a dew days the Guru was tested by Devidas and he was found wanting. Twelve years before Baba arrived in Shirdi with the marriage party, this Devidas aged about 10 or 11 came to Shirdi and lived in the Maruti temple. Devidas had the fine features and brilliant
      eyes, and he was dispassion incarnate and a Jnani. Many persons, namely Tatya Kote, Kashinath and others regarded, him as their Guru. They brought Javhar Ali in his presence, and in the discussion that followed; Javhar was worsted and fled from Shirdi. He went
      and stayed in Bijapur and returned after many years to Shirdi, and prostrated himself before Sai Baba. The Delusion that he was Guru and Sai Baba his Chela was cleared away, and as he repented, Sai Baba treated him with respect. In this case Sai Baba showed by
      actual conduct how one should get rid of egoism and do the duties of a disciple of attain the highest end, viz., self-realization. This story is told here according to the version given by Mahalsapati (a great devotee of Baba).
